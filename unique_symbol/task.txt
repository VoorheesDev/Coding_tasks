You need to develop an algorithm for a program that should do the following:
- the program accepts an arbitrary text as input and finds in each word of this text the very first symbol
that is NOT repeated in the analyzed word
- further, from the received set of symbols, the program must select the first unique one
(the one that is no longer found in the set) and return it.
